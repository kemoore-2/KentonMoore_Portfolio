Work Portfolio 

# [Project 1: Enhancing UAV Drone Defenses through Binary Classification](https://kemoore-2.github.io/KentonMoore_Portfolio/).
*Conducted research to improve defenses for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles against vulnerabilities.

*Addressed the challenge of illegal drone sightings by developing a Python binary classification model using Logistic Regression.

*Used the DJI Terra software to visualize environmental data from the pictures.

*Cleaned datasets on illegal drone sightings reported to the FAA.

*Used Power BI to visualize drone sighting metrics across U.S. states.

*Collaborated on the AI and Shared Autonomy project with North Carolina A&T, funded by the Office of
Naval Research.

*Presented research and findings at North Carolina A&T State University's 2025 Spring Research
Symposium.
